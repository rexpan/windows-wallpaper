# windows-wallpaper

`app.js` will download images from [EarthPorn](https://www.reddit.com/r/EarthPorn/) and others to `./img` folder.
On Windows 10, you can set a slideshow as wallpaper with location point to `./img` folder.

`job.js` will auto change the wallpaper, but you should use Windows provided function.
